# EPL_Data_Analysis

##Overview
This is a little project to practice some data analysis techniques using historical English Premier League table data. 

The **epl_data_scrape.R** script in this repository was written to scrape Wikipedia for EPL table data from its inception in 1992 through 2015 and consolidate into one large dataframe for analysis. The script saves the dataframe as a csv file for easy import/export by others.

This was my first attempt at web-scraping using R and I was very impressed with how the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest package">Rvest</a> made the whole process!
